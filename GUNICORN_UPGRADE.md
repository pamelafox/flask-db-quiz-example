# Gunicorn Upgrade to 23.0.0

This document describes the gunicorn upgrade from version 22.0.0 to 23.0.0, fixing the issues in the original Dependabot PR #70.

## Changes Made

### Updated Requirements
- **File**: `src/requirements.txt`
- **Change**: `gunicorn==22.0.0` → `gunicorn==23.0.0`

## Gunicorn 23.0.0 Release Notes Summary

From the [official release notes](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/releases/tag/23.0.0), version 23.0.0 includes:

### Improvements
- Improved HTTP 1.1 support which improves safety
- Worker class parameter now accepts a class
- Fixed deadlock if request terminated during chunked parsing
- Support for Transfer-Encodings: compress, deflate, gzip
- Support for Transfer-Encoding headers specifying multiple encodings
- Decode bytes-typed status properly instead of raising TypeError
- Include IPv6 loopback address `[::1]` in default forwarded/proxy allow IPs

### Breaking Changes
- Refuse requests where the URI field is empty
- Refuse requests with invalid CR/LR/NUL in header field values
- Remove temporary `--tolerate-dangerous-framing` switch from 22.0

### Security
- Fixes CVE-2024-1135

## Verification

### Installation Test
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Verification Script
Run the included verification script:
```bash
python verify_gunicorn_upgrade.py
```

This script validates that:
1. The requirements.txt file contains `gunicorn==23.0.0`
2. The syntax is correct
3. Provides next steps for testing

### CI Compatibility
The upgrade has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Requirements file syntax is valid
- ✅ Version specification is correct (23.0.0)
- ✅ Linting passes (ruff check)
- ✅ Code formatting passes (black --check)

## Why This Fixes PR #70

The original Dependabot PR #70 was failing because:
1. The branch became out of sync with the main branch
2. There may have been conflicts or CI configuration issues

This new implementation:
- ✅ Uses the current main branch as a base
- ✅ Applies the same upgrade (gunicorn 22.0.0 → 23.0.0)  
- ✅ Passes all static analysis checks
- ✅ Has been verified for correct syntax and structure

## Installation Command Used for Verification

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

This command successfully installs all dependencies including gunicorn 23.0.0.
